# Text analysis of Hezbollah speeches

## Project
This repository is for the "Text as Data for Islamist Data" Project, including the Widening participation internship.

### Internship aims
In the internship we have three aims:
- Text pre-processing tasks in English translations
- Text pre-processing tasks Arabic
- Compare results of English and Arabic Natural Language Processing, for either:
    - Key words (as provided by Filippo) over time
    - Most frequent words over time
    - Comparison of Jerusalem Day speeches versus background

Later, we hope to bring this code into Filippo's Orange workflow to form part of future analyses.
